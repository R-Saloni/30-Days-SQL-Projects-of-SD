🎯 SQL Assignment & Final Project Completion 🚀
I'm excited to share that I have successfully completed my SQL assignment and the final 30th-day project on an Online Book Store, as part of the 30 Days SQL Micro Course by Satish Dhawale via SkillCourse.

📌 What I Worked On:
✅ SQL queries for hospital data analysis 🏥
✅ Aggregations, joins, and analytical functions 📊
✅ Optimizing queries for performance 🚀
✅ Final project: Online Book Store Database – covering schema design, queries, and transactions for a real-world bookstore system 📚


This course has been a great journey in mastering SQL for real-world applications. Thanks to SkillCourse and Satish Dhawale for this amazing learning experience!

Looking forward to working on more data-driven projects! 🚀
